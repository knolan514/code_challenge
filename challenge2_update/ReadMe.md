Challenge 2:
You will take in a text file that is given to you as a command line argument. That text file will be composed of several lines of strings. You must take each line and determine if that line is a palindrome, if it is, then you will print AY, else you will print NAY. Then you will print a |, then the line sorted in reverse lexical order without the white space characters.

Python:
	To run this, I used Terminal:
	$ python nazgul.py textFile.txt

Rust:
	To run this, I used Terminal:
	$ cargo build
	$ cargo run textFile.txt

	If you don't have cargo set up:
	$ git clone https://github.com/knolan514/mordor-challenge.git
	$ cd mordor-challenge
	$ cargo build
	$ cargo run textFile.txt
